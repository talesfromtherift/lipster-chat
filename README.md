# To Build #

Lipster Chat uses Photon Networking - please obtain a Photon Real-time free/paid license key from ttps://www.photonengine.com/en/PUN then set it in Windows -> Photon Unity Networking -> Hilight Server Settings

If you want to use Mixpanel Analytics, please obtain a Mixppanel token from http://mixpanel.com then set it in the Lobby Scene - DontDestroyOnLoad -> MixpanelVR -> Mixpanel Project Token property.

Finally, build with both the (1) Lobby and (2) Chat scenes.
